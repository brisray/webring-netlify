# Chill Programmer Vibes

Note -- I took the source code from [this guide](https://mxb.dev/blog/webring-kit/).

## Getting started
Check out [the website](https://chillprogrammers.netlify.app) for the instructions. If you're here to add yourself as a member, 
add your info to `src/data/members.json` and submit a PR. I'm going to change the style of the central website at one point to match the style of my website, 
or maybe something different idk.

If you, like me, strongly dislike the look of the banner that contains the `next` and `prev` buttons, you can disable that by just deleting the script tag in the code snippet. 
I may delete that since I find it super annoying but I am keeping it now just in case someone wants it.
